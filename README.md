Mastermind is one of my favourite board games: someone makes a code conisisted of different colors and other players try to guess it
In my journey of learning swift, I decided to remake this game as a 1-player cmd game!
To play, either dowload the source code and run the code, or get a build from the releases page and double click the .exe to run!
